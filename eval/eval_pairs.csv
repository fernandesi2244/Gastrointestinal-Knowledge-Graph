Is the guaiac-based FOBT reliable for detecting colorectal bleeding?,"Guaiac-Based FOBT (Guaiac Test)
The guaiac-based FOBT may detect both human and non-human (e.g., from dietary sources) hemoglobin. This is the major limitation of this test, resulting in a high proportion of false positives and low positive predictive values [194,195]. The high-sensitivity guaiac-based FOBT was introduced to improve the sensitivity of the guaiac-based FOBT, although the limitation of low specificity remains, suggesting that policymakers should replace this method with more accurate methods in population-based screening programs [196,197,198,199]."
What are the current risk factors and prevention strategies for colorectal cancer?,"An updated, concise review of all of this information may be helpful for researchers, physicians, and policymakers. In this review, we performed a comprehensive search of the latest available literature to present the most updated evidence on the epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention of CRC. 2."
Does an imbalance in my gut bacteria increase my risk of colorectal cancer?,"They found a negative correlation between the Lachnospiraceae species and CRC risk, while the Porphyromonadaceae species, Lachnospiraceae UCG010 genus, Lachnospira genus, and Sellimonas genus had a positive relationship with the risk of CRC. Their findings suggested causal relationships between the intestinal microbiome and the risk of CRC. The results of this study revealed that dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota may play an important role in development of CRC, suggesting their potential implications in CRC prevention [141]."
"What are the common chemotherapy combinations used for colorectal cancer, and how do targeted drugs improve treatment?","The above chemotherapy drugs are often used in combination, and commonly used combination chemotherapy regimens include FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, CAPEOX, FOLFOXIRI, etc. (26). The application of molecularly targeted drugs has brought significant benefits to CRC patients."
Is measuring CEA levels a reliable way to screen for colorectal cancer?,"It has been reported that CEA fluctuates greatly in healthy individuals, and its variation in the same individual can reach 30%, leading to controversy over its value in screening asymptomatic people and diagnosing CRC (39). Therefore, CEA and CA19–9 are not suitable as screening and diagnostic markers for CRC. Colonoscopy can visually observe the shape, size, and location of colorectal lesions."
Is the FIT test more accurate than the FOBT for detecting colon issues?,"Although the sensitivity and specificity of FIT are higher than FOBT (78% and 96%, respectively) (34), and diet restriction is not required, the detection results of the FIT are susceptible to non-hemorrhagic tumors and hemorrhagic non-tumor diseases (35, 36). On the other hand, patients, and their family members’ aversion to handling stool specimens restrict the development of this examination. Data from the UK study showed that only 50% of patients undergoing FOBT had a specimen sent in (37)."
Could the blood in my stool be a sign of colon cancer?,"Common symptoms of colon cancer include:

Blood on or in your stool (poop): Talk to a healthcare provider if you notice blood in the toilet after you poop or after wiping, or if your poop looks dark or bright red. It’s important to remember blood in poop doesn’t mean you have colon cancer. Other things — from hemorrhoids to anal tears to eating beets — may change your poop’s appearance."
When should I see my healthcare provider for follow-up after colon cancer treatment?,Palliative care helps people manage cancer symptoms and treatment side effects. When should I see my healthcare provider? Follow-up colon cancer care varies depending on the cancer stage.
"What is the difference between a fecal DNA test, a flexible sigmoidoscopy, and a virtual colonoscopy?","Fecal DNA test: This test looks for signs of genetic mutations and blood products in your poop. Flexible sigmoidoscopy: Healthcare providers use a flexible scope called a sigmoidoscope to see inside your lower colon and rectum. Virtual colonoscopy: A virtual colonoscopy is an X-ray that looks for polyps, tumors and ulcers (sores) in your colon and rectum."
Does being obese increase my risk of developing or dying from colon cancer?,Obesity. People who are obese have an increased risk of colon cancer. Obesity also increases the risk of dying of colon cancer.
Why do some cells keep living and form a tumor instead of dying naturally?,The changes let the cells continue living when healthy cells die as part of their natural lifecycle. This causes too many cells. The cells might form a mass called a tumor.
"What could be causing rectal bleeding, abdominal cramps, and the feeling that my bowel isn't fully emptying?","Rectal bleeding or blood in the stool. Ongoing discomfort in the belly area, such as cramps, gas or pain. A feeling that the bowel doesn't empty all the way during a bowel movement."
Does pembrolizumab work better than chemotherapy for tumors with high PD-L1 expression?,"In KEYNOTE-062, overall survival was improved compared with chemotherapy in pembrolizumab monotherapy treated patients who had tumours with high expression of PD-L1 (CPS ≥10), although this finding was not statistically significant (figure 5), and this group requires further study in future. Despite encouraging early results for the combination of chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 therapy, the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy did not improve survival compared with chemotherapy alone in a randomised trial regardless of PD-L1 expression status.174, 175 However, early reports from the ATTRACTION-4176 and CHECKMATE 649177 trials suggest that the combination of nivolumab with chemotherapy might be more effective than chemotherapy alone. Other biomarkers including EBV and tumour mutation burden are currently being evaluated."
What are the risk factors for developing gastric cancer?,"With over 1 million estimated new cases annually, gastric cancer is the fifth most diagnosed malignancy worldwide. Due to its frequently advanced stage at diagnosis, mortality from gastric cancer is high, making it the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths, with 784 000 deaths globally in 2018.1 Hotspots of incidence and mortality for gastric cancer exist in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America (figure 1). The incidence of gastric cancer is two times higher in males than in females.1 A steady decline in the incidence and mortality rates of this cancer have been observed over the past century."
How is gastric cancer diagnosed and what are the main treatment options for early-stage disease?,"Gastric cancer is diagnosed histologically after endoscopic biopsy and staged using CT, endoscopic ultrasound, PET, and laparoscopy. It is a molecularly and phenotypically highly heterogeneous disease. The main treatment for early gastric cancer is endoscopic resection."
What symptoms or signs should I look for that might indicate advanced gastric cancer?,"[10] 

Physical Examination Findings

Physical examination findings in gastric cancer are typically evident only in the advanced stages of the disease. These may include an abdominal mass or a dilated stomach suggestive of gastric outlet obstruction. Metastatic gastric cancer can present with several distinctive signs, including the Virchow node (ie, left supraclavicular adenopathy), Sister Mary Joseph node (ie, periumbilical nodule), and Irish node (ie, left axillary node)."
Is trastuzumab an effective treatment option for HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer?,"Targeted agents like trastuzumab have shown efficacy in advanced gastric cancer. The ToGA trial added trastuzumab to chemotherapy in HER2-positive individuals, improving median overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate without significant toxicity differences. [39] Consequently, trastuzumab with chemotherapy is the standard for HER2-positive cancers."
Does eating a diet high in smoked or cured foods increase my risk of gastric cancer related to Epstein-Barr virus?,"Epstein-Barr virus: This viral infection has been increasingly noted in association with gastric cancer, usually affecting the proximal stomach. [6] Please see StatPearls' companion resource, ""Epstein-Barr Virus,"" for more information. Dietary factors: Risk factors include high salt intake (salt-preserved foods), consumption of N-nitroso compounds, smoking, a diet low in vitamins A and C, high consumption of smoked or cured foods, lack of refrigerated foods, and contaminated drinking water."
Could my stomach pain and weight loss be a sign of a serious condition?,"Only your provider can make a definitive diagnosis. See your provider if you have symptoms like stomach pain and unexplained weight loss with or without symptoms, like:

Trouble eating. Diarrhea."
Where in my stomach is stomach cancer most likely to develop?,"Cancer can form anywhere in your stomach. In the U.S., most cases of stomach cancer involve abnormal cell growth in the place where your stomach meets your esophagus (gastroesophageal junction). In other countries, where gastric cancer is more common, cancer usually forms in the main part of your stomach."
"Could my black or bloody stool be a sign of cancer, and where might the tumor be located?",Bloody or black stool. What questions should I ask my doctor? Where is the cancer located?
What are the early signs of stomach cancer that I should watch out for?,"Most stomach cancers are found when the disease is advanced and a cure is less likely. Stomach cancer that grows through the stomach wall or spreads to other parts of the body is harder to cure. Symptoms
Signs and symptoms of stomach cancer may include:

Trouble swallowing
Belly pain
Feeling bloated after eating
Feeling full after eating small amounts of food
Not feeling hungry when you would expect to be hungry
Heartburn
Indigestion
Nausea
Vomiting
Losing weight without trying
Feeling very tired
Stools that look black
Stomach cancer doesn't always cause symptoms in its early stages."
Should I reduce my intake of salty and smoked foods to protect my stomach?,Reduce the amount of salty and smoked foods you eat. Protect your stomach by limiting these foods. Stop smoking.
Could my stomach lymphoma be related to my immune system fighting an infection?,Lymphoma can sometimes start in the stomach if the body sends immune system cells to the stomach. This might happen if the body is trying to fight off an infection. Most lymphomas that start in the stomach are a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
What are the chances that new immunotherapy approaches could improve my treatment for pancreatic cancer?,"Data from a small phase 1b study of metastatic pancreatic cancer patients using a CD40 agnostic antibody, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel with or without nivolumab showed an impressive response rate of 58% in the first-line setting.116
The pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumour microenvironment is also characterised by a dearth of high quality, infiltrating effector T cells. Several vaccine-based studies are ongoing to induce infiltration of effector T cells. One such approach uses granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-secreting allogeneic pancreatic tumour cells to induce T cells against a broad repertoire of pancreatic cancer antigens but has yet to result in improved clinical outcomes.117 Effective immunotherapeutic strategies are likely to necessitate a multifaceted approach that involve strategies to induce infiltration of T cells (eg, vaccine-based approaches), combined with immunostimulatory approaches (eg, checkpoint inhibitors) as well as strategies to target the immunosuppressive microenvironment (eg, CD40-agonist antibodies)."
How does the mutation in the KRAS gene contribute to the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma?,"A minority of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma arises from cystic neoplasms such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN); however, IPMNs are often found to co-localise with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and might have a distinct genetic signature suggesting divergent development.29 Molecular characterisation of the progression from grade 1 and 2 pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has been well described in the literature. Grade 1 and 2 pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias are characterised by point mutations in the KRAS oncogene (found in approximately 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma), particularly within codon 12, resulting in constitutive downstream signalling through the RAS and PI3K–AKT pathways and subsequent cell cycle progression and increased cell survival and motility (figure 1). Telomere shortening is a characteristic feature of grade 1 pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, perhaps predisposing cells toward developing mutations through chromosomal instability.30 Early pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias, particularly grade 2 lesions, are associated with inactivation of two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, CDKN2A (and its encoded protein p16) and CDKN1A (and its encoded protein p21)."
Is there a targeted therapy available for my pancreatic cancer based on my biomarker status?,"In December, 2019, olaparib gained approval in the USA for use in this setting—the first biomarker-based targeted therapy approved for pancreatic cancer.101
The only second-line therapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer that has shown a survival advantage in a phase 3 study is the combination of fluorouracil plus leucovorin with nanoliposomal irinotecan. In the NAPOLI-1 trial, patients with metastatic disease who had progressed on gemcitabine-based therapy were found to have an increased median overall survival with fluorouracil plus leucovorin with nanoliposomal irinotecan compared with fluorouracil plus leucovorin (6·1 vs 4·2 months, HR 0·67; p=0·012).102 For patients who progressed on first-line FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy is an appropriate second-line option for patients with an adequate performance status for chemotherapy. Supportive care
Supportive care is a crucial component of the management of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer."
What are the risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer?,"This activity describes the pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management. Objectives:

Describe the risk factors for pancreatic cancer. Review the presentation of a patient with pancreatic cancer."
What are the potential complications I should be aware of after a Whipple procedure?,"Consultations
Palliative and/or supportive care, hospice, dietary, nutrition, physical therapy, occupational therapy

Deterrence and Patient Education
It is important to discuss with the patient all the treatment options before discussing surgery. Pearls and Other Issues
Delayed gastric emptying is a common complication of the Whipple procedure. Similarly, anastomotic leaks pose significant morbidity to the patient."
What are the common tumor markers used to diagnose pancreatic cancer?,"These genetic patterns can later be used to create targeted therapy, potentially improving survival in pancreatic cancer patients. Toxicokinetics
Tumor markers associated with pancreatic cancer include CEA and CA 19-9. History and Physical
Patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas typically present with painless jaundice (50%), usually due to obstruction of the common bile duct from the pancreatic head tumor."
"Could my hereditary gene mutations, like BRCA1 or BRCA2, increase my risk of developing chronic pancreatitis?","Chronic pancreatitis, a permanent inflammation of your pancreas. Hereditary chronic pancreatitis due to gene changes (mutations) passed from biological parent to child. Hereditary syndromes with changes (mutations) in genes, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes passed from biological parent to child."
What are the possible side effects of this treatment?,What side effects might I develop as a result of treatment? Is genetic testing right for me? Are there clinical trials available?
Could a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 increase my risk of pancreatic cancer?,"It can also help your healthcare provider determine which type of treatment will be most effective for you. Some people with pancreatic cancer have mutations in genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Though you may recognize these genes as the “breast cancer genes,” mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 may also indicate other types of cancer, including prostate, ovarian and pancreatic."
What are the symptoms of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and how is it diagnosed?,It makes enzymes that help digest food and hormones that help manage blood sugar. The most common type of pancreatic cancer is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This type begins in the cells that line the ducts that carry digestive enzymes out of the pancreas.
Should I get screened for pancreatic cancer to catch it early?,"The goal of screening is to find pancreatic cancer when it's small and most likely to be cured. Research is ongoing, so it's not yet clear whether screening can lower the risk of dying of pancreatic cancer. There are risks to screening."
Will this procedure help relieve my abdominal pain caused by nerve signals?,This procedure uses a needle to put alcohol into the nerves that control pain in the belly. The alcohol stops the nerves from sending pain signals to the brain. Bowel blockage.
