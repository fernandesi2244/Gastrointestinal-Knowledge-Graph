Summary
Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer death globally. Risk factors for the condition include Helicobacter pylori infection, age, high salt intake, and diets low in fruit and vegetables. Gastric cancer is diagnosed histologically after endoscopic biopsy and staged using CT, endoscopic ultrasound, PET, and laparoscopy. It is a molecularly and phenotypically highly heterogeneous disease. The main treatment for early gastric cancer is endoscopic resection. Non-early operable gastric cancer is treated with surgery, which should include D2 lymphadenectomy (including lymph node stations in the perigastric mesentery and along the celiac arterial branches). Perioperative or adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in patients with stage 1B or higher cancers. Advanced gastric cancer is treated with sequential lines of chemotherapy, starting with a platinum and fluoropyrimidine doublet in the first line; median survival is less than 1 year. Targeted therapies licensed to treat gastric cancer include trastuzumab (HER2-positive patients first line), ramucirumab (anti-angiogenic second line), and nivolumab or pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 third line).

Epidemiology and risk factors
Gastric cancer is a globally important disease. With over 1 million estimated new cases annually, gastric cancer is the fifth most diagnosed malignancy worldwide. Due to its frequently advanced stage at diagnosis, mortality from gastric cancer is high, making it the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths, with 784 000 deaths globally in 2018.1 Hotspots of incidence and mortality for gastric cancer exist in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America (figure 1). The incidence of gastric cancer is two times higher in males than in females.1 A steady decline in the incidence and mortality rates of this cancer have been observed over the past century. However, despite declining incidence rates in most countries, clinicians can expect to see more gastric cancer cases in the future due to ageing populations. Improved living conditions associated with economic development have contributed to the reduction in the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori, the major cause of gastric cancer.3 In high incidence areas such as Japan and Korea, screening programmes have also led to substantial reductions in gastric cancer associated mortality.4, 5, 6 An observed increase in the incidence in younger people from high-income countries suggests a change in disease risk and epidemiology of gastric cancer. Attention to ongoing transitions in gastric cancer epidemiology is therefore relevant to future cancer control and clinical practice.7

H pylori infection is the most well described risk factor for non-cardia gastric cancer. Chronic infection of the gastric mucosa leads to stepwise progression from atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia.8 The majority of the population infected with H pylori remain asymptomatic. Gastric cancer due to H pylori infection is associated with bacterial virulence, genetic polymorphism of hosts, and environmental factors. Most H pylori strains possess a cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) pathogenicity island, encoding a 120–140 kDa CagA protein, an oncoprotein that affects the expression of cellular signalling proteins.9, 10 Treatment of H pylori can reduce the risk of transformation to gastric cancer, but the magnitude of risk reduction depends on the degree of pre-existing damage at the time of eradication. According to current recommendations, eradication of H pylori should be done in the following risk populations: pan-gastritis and corpus-predominant gastritis, first-degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer, and previous gastric neoplasia.11, 12, 13, 14 Risk factors beyond H pylori for non-cardia gastric cancer are older age, low socio-economic status, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, familial predisposition, previous gastric surgery, pernicious anaemia, and living in a population at high risk.15, 16, 17 Salted food intake might increase the risk of H pylori infection and could also act synergistically to promote the development of gastric cancer. Therefore, dietary modification involving less salt and salted food intake is one possible strategy to prevent gastric cancer. Gastric cancer risk might be decreased with a high intake of fruit and vegetables.18 In contrast to distal gastric cancer, a positive association between gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and proximal (cardia type) gastric cancer has been shown.19, 20
Genetics of gastric cancer
Approximately 10% of all gastric cancer cases show familial aggregation and 1–3% of patients with gastric cancer have germline mutations.21 Hereditary forms of gastric cancer can be subdivided into three groups:21, 22, 23 hereditary diffuse type gastric cancer (HDGC; autosomal dominant; <1% all gastric cancer); familial intestinal gastric cancer (autosomal dominant); and gastric adenocarcinoma with proximal polyposis of the stomach (autosomal dominant).
30–40% of patients with HDGC carry mutations in the CDH1 gene which encodes E-cadherin. Patients meeting screening criteria for CDH1 testing should be referred to a clinical geneticist and patients with identified pathogenic CDH1 mutations should be managed at expert centres. Prophylactic total gastrectomy is recommended for individuals with pathogenic CDH1 mutations.24 In three HDGC families, a germline mutation in CTNNA1 was found, which encodes for αE-catenin.25 Potential other candidate genes for HDGC include PALB2, the insulin receptor, F-Box Protein 24 (FBXO24), and DOT1-like histone H3K79 methyltransferase (DOT1-L) genes.26, 27 However, in approximately 70% of patients with HDGC, the underlying genetic alteration is currently unknown. Gastric adenocarcinoma with proximal polyposis of the stomach has been shown to be associated with point mutations in the APC promotor 1B gene.28 Furthermore, gastric cancer more frequently occurs in other hereditary diseases such as familial adenomatous polyposis (APC), Lynch syndrome (MLH1, MLH2, PMS2, and MSH6), Cowden syndrome (PTEN), juvenile polyposis (BMPR1A and SMAD4), Li-Fraumeni syndrome (TP53), MUTYH-associated adenomatous polyposis (MUTYH) and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (STK11).29
Histological classification systems
The macroscopic appearance of early gastric cancers is described as protruded (type I), superficial (type II), or excavated (type III).30, 31 Type II lesions are further subdivided into elevated, flat, or depressed. The macroscopic appearance of advanced early gastric cancers is commonly classified according to Borrmann32 into four types: polypoid without ulceration and broad base (type I), ulcerated with elevated borders and sharp margins (type II), ulcerated with diffuse infiltration at the base (type III), and diffusely infiltrative thickening of the wall (type IV). The Borrmann type appears to be an independent prognostic factor and patients with type IV gastric cancer having the poorest survival.33
Early and advanced stage gastric cancer are both characterised by extensive morphological diversity resulting in a still growing number of classification systems. The most commonly used classifications outside Japan, are those from Nakamura and colleagues,34 Laurén,35 and WHO.36 The Nakamura classification distinguishes the differentiated type from the undifferentiated type, and forms an essential part of the indication criteria for endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer.34, 37 The Laurén classification distinguishes intestinal type, diffuse type, and indeterminate or unclassifiable type.35 Since Laurén's original publication, a large number of special types of gastric cancer have been identified which do not fit into the Laurén types. The WHO classification of gastric adenocarcinoma has been criticised for its complexity distinguishing many subtypes (tubular, parietal cell, papillary, micropapillary, mucoepidermoid, mucinous, poorly cohesive, signet ring cell, medullary carcinoma with lymphoid stroma, hepatoid, and Paneth cell type), some of which are very rare.8 There is conflicting evidence about the ability of the histopathological phenotype to predict patient prognosis or response to therapy. This conflicting evidence is most likely related to the variation in the histopathological classification, an issue that has been addressed for gastric cancer with signet ring cells in a consensus statement by expert pathologists.38
Genomic classification systems
Several different molecular gastric cancers classification systems have been proposed in the past decade often attempting to relate molecular features to histological phenotypes and clinical features.39, 40 In 2014, results from the most comprehensive integrated genome-wide analyses of DNA copy number alterations, mutations, mRNA, miRNA, and protein patterns done by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) research network was published and four molecularly distinct gastric cancer subtypes were proposed: Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+), microsatellite instable (MSI), genomically stable, and chromosomal unstable (CIN).41 MSI, CIN, and EBV+ had previously been identified as distinct subtypes, but had never been characterised in such molecular detail before.42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48 Showing some overlap with TCGA, in an analysis based on mRNA expression profiling done by the Asian Cancer Research Group, gastric cancers were classified as MSI, microsatellite stable (MSS) or epithelial mesenchymal transition, MSS with TP53 intact, or MSS with TP53 loss.49 TP53 mutation or overexpression by immunohistochemistry has been proposed as a surrogate for the presence of CIN. Although molecular characteristics (either specific gene alterations or broader molecular subtypes) rather than morphological features might guide future treatment development, Laurén's classification is still the most commonly used for subgroup analyses in clinical trials. The proposed molecular classifications overlap substantially with existing molecular and morphological classifications as illustrated in figure 2.

CIN=chromosomal unstable. GS=genomically unstable. MSI=microsatellite instable. EBV+=Epstein-Barr virus positive.
These molecular analyses have increased our knowledge regarding gastric cancer biology; however, the clinical importance (prognosis and response to therapy) of these subgroups is currently only strongly supported for the MSI or EBV+ gastric cancers subtypes.50, 51, 52, 53 Additional molecular subgroup testing is not yet done in routine clinical practice as clinical decisions are currently not based on molecular subtypes. However, mismatch repair deficiency and HER2 are routinely tested as these are strongly predictive biomarkers for drug therapy.
New developments in gastric cancer pathology
Digital image analysis
Recently developed deep learning methodology using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images has shown potential to rapidly detect adenocarcinoma in gastric biopsies and resection specimens with relatively high sensitivity and specificity, supporting future diagnostic pathology workflow as well as translational research by accurately segmenting gastric cancer regions for further analysis.54, 55, 56, 57 Traditionally, histological gastric cancer classification has been based on features of the epithelial tumour component. However, there are other histological features in the tumour microenvironment, such as tumour infiltrating lymphocytes or the proportion of intratumoural stroma, which are emerging as potential clinically useful prognostic or predictive factors.58, 59, 60, 61 These features can be assessed using multiplexed immunofluorescence staining combined with automatic image analysis to quantitatively characterise the biomarker of interest and evaluate its clinical importance.62, 63, 64, 65 Studies have shown that deep learning algorithms applied to H&E stained slides can predict microsatellite instability in gastric cancer54 as well as specific mutations in other cancers.66 The practical implications of being able to accurately classify different types of gastric cancer, predict driver mutations, microsatellite instability status, and other features using deep learning technology on low-cost H&E stained slides could potentially be enormous.
Liquid biopsies
Liquid biopsies including the detection of cell-free circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumour cells, exosomes, and tumour educated platelets have the potential to transform cancer diagnosis, disease monitoring, response prediction, and identification of recurrent disease. Furthermore, liquid biopsies could provide a more representative view of heterogeneous tumours, such as gastric cancer, compared with tissue biopsies. So far, results from ctDNA, rather than other forms of liquid biopsy, have been most promising in patients with gastric cancer. However, with the currently used gene panels, the ctDNA detection rate in patients with early stage gastric cancer is low. Nevertheless, if ctDNA is detectable before gastrectomy, a decrease in ctDNA after chemotherapy appears to be associated with response to neoadjuvant treatment and if detected after gastrectomy, is associated with disease recurrence and poor survival.67, 68 Therefore, ctDNA detection in patients with gastric cancer might be a new clinically useful marker for minimal residual disease monitoring, which could potentially guide new adjuvant treatment strategies. As intratumour heterogeneity in gastric cancer might influence detection of HER2 amplification in tumour tissue,69 circulating tumour cells or ctDNA analyses could have added value for detecting HER2 amplification70, 71 or revealing patterns of resistance to trastuzumab.72 Although promising, further validation of these studies is needed before clinical implementation.
Symptoms and diagnosis
The most common symptoms associated with gastric cancer are indigestion (dyspepsia), anorexia (poor appetite) or early satiety, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Dysphagia or regurgitation might occur in proximal gastric cancer or cancers located at the gastroesophageal junction. Anaemia might be present in bleeding cancers. If symptoms are present at the time of diagnosis, the disease is often advanced and incurable.
Gastric cancer is diagnosed by endoscopic examination during which the tumour localisation within the stomach and its macroscopic type are determined and biopsies are taken for histological confirmation. Clinical staging determines whether the treatment approach will be curative or palliative. All patients should be staged according to the latest edition of the Union for International Cancer Control and American Joint Committee on Cancer and reviewed at an experienced multidisciplinary tumour board before determining a treatment pathway.73, 74 CT of the abdomen and chest provides information on the presence of metastases in the liver, lung, or peritoneum. Endoscopic ultrasound could be helpful for identifying superficial that do not penetrate further than the submucosa (T1) or muscularis propria (T2) from advanced cancers (T3–T4). Endoscopic ultrasound is able to discriminate between T1 and T2 cancers with a sensitivity and specificity of 0·85 (95% CI 0·78–0·91) for T1 and 0·90 (0·85–0·93) for T2.75 Early T-stage, along with tumour size, differentiation, and the presence of ulceration might be helpful to identify patients suitable for endoscopic resection. PET-CT might be helpful in detecting CT-occult metastases but is less sensitive in mucinous or diffuse type cancers.76 Peritoneal relapse is common in patients with resected gastric cancer, especially in patients with diffuse type cancers. Explorative laparoscopy to detect peritoneal metastases is recommended for patients with gastric cancer at stage 1B or higher for whom surgical resection is planned.73 Patients with positive cytology on peritoneal lavage have high rates of disease recurrence following surgery, although conversion to negative cytology following chemotherapy could be associated with better survival outcomes.77
Surgery for gastric cancer
Despite advances in understanding the biology of gastric cancer, surgical or endoscopic resection is still a mandatory backbone in treatment with curative intent. In the past decades, gastric cancer surgery has been dominated by two main themes: a discussion of the optimal extent of lymphadenectomy; and the rapid digital technology development of screen-based intervention techniques that have led to minimally invasive interventions such as endoscopic mucosal resections for early gastric cancer and laparoscopic and robotic gastrectomy techniques for early and locally advanced gastric cancer.
Endoscopic resection
Endoscopic resection is now established as upfront management for most early gastric cancer cases and can be considered as a definitive treatment unless substantial risk factors for lymph node metastases are present.78, 79, 80 The strongest risk factor for lymph node metastasis is the presence of lymphovascular invasion. Other risk factors include submucosal invasion (T1b), poor differentiation, ulceration, and large tumour size.78 There are currently two main endoscopic resection techniques: endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). EMR is robust and technically reproducible with a short learning curve, whereas ESD is technically more demanding and therefore has a much longer learning curve during which there could be morbidity. However, ESD usually results in en-bloc specimens, higher proportion of complete resections, and fewer local recurrences.81, 82 Asian and European guidelines recommend ESD as the endoscopic resection method of choice for early gastric cancer.76, 79
Types of gastrectomy
For clinically staged T1 lymph node positive (N+) and T2–T4a of any node status, and gastric cancer without distant metastasis, the main treatment is surgical resection with adequate lymphadenectomy and chemotherapy either before and after (perioperative), or just after (adjuvant) resection. The purpose of the surgery is to achieve a locally radical resection (eg, all resection margins free from tumour and all relevant regional lymph nodes removed). The main procedures used are distal gastrectomy (resection of the distal two thirds of the stomach and anastomosis of the proximal stomach to the small bowel) or total gastrectomy with anastomosis of the oesophagus to the small bowel. These procedures involve resection of the pylorus leading to rapid bolus passage to the small bowel, strongly contributing to long-term problems with dumping syndrome and weight loss.83, 84
Pylorus function preserving procedures, such as pylorus-preserving gastrectomy or proximal gastrectomy with so-called double tract reconstruction, have been introduced with promising reports of less dumping symptoms and less weight loss, combined with acceptable oncological outcomes for T1 cancers for which endoscopic resection does not suffice.84, 85, 86, 87 Care must be taken to spare the hepatic and pyloric branches of the vagal nerve, as well as the infrapyloric artery to preserve pyloric function. These procedures might not generally be feasible in non-Asian settings due to the low number of patients diagnosed with early gastric cancer as a certain case volume is needed to overcome the learning curve. The mechanism of dumping symptoms has been shown to be mediated by the gastrointestinal glucagon-like peptide, and promising data suggest that blocking this peptide could relieve dumping symptoms and reduce weight loss after gastrectomy.88, 89, 90 Within the next few years, anti-dumping pharmaceutical drugs could be available to patients in clinical practice.
Lymphadenectomy
The optimal extent of lymphadenectomy has been extensively discussed in the past decades. Japanese registry data, mapping the likelihood of lymph node metastasis from each primary tumour location to the specific lymph node stations, has led to the definition of specific levels of lymph node dissection.79 A D1 dissection aims to clear only the lymph nodes with the highest risk of involvement and thus all perigastric and left gastric artery lymph nodes are removed. In a D2 dissection, all D1 lymph nodes and lymph nodes along the common hepatic, proper hepatic, and splenic artery, excluding the splenic hilar nodes as well as those along the coeliac axis are removed.79 In addition, a D3 dissection has been described, which includes all D2 lymph node stations, supplemented with well defined abdominal paraaortic and hepatoduodenal lymph nodes.
East Asian observational studies as well as a randomised trial from Taiwan have convincingly shown a better survival with D2 gastrectomy than D1 gastrectomy.91, 92 Three D1 versus D2 gastrectomy trials have been done in Europe. Both the British and Dutch trials did not show an initial survival benefit after D2 dissection, partly explained by extremely high postoperative mortality after D2 in these early trials.93, 94 However, in the Dutch trial, long-term follow-up showed less loco-regional recurrences and lower cancer-related mortality after D2.95 A per-protocol analysis, where pathologically confirmed D1 and D2 dissections were compared, showed better survival after D2 surgery.96 An Italian trial with very low postoperative mortality, but hampered by non-compliance regarding the lymphadenectomy in both groups, showed a statistically borderline significant survival benefit in lymph node-positive patients after D2 gastrectomy.97, 98 A Japanese randomised trial showed that routinely performed super-extended D3 lymphadenectomy was of no benefit compared with D2 for patients with regional disease.99 Currently, there is international consensus supporting that gastrectomy for non-early gastric cancer should include a D2 lymphadenectomy in patients who are medically fit and should be done in specialised, high-volume centres.73, 79, 100
Enhanced recovery and minimally invasive surgery
In the past decades, great efforts have been undertaken to reduce postoperative complications and expedite recovery after surgery. Two main fields of development to this end are: enhanced recovery programmes that are trying to optimise perioperative care, standardise clinical pathways, and promote early postoperative mobilisation and self care;101 and the development of minimally invasive techniques of gastrectomy with the potential to cause less entry wound trauma and through high resolution screen-based surgery to improve operative field vision.
Laparoscopic gastrectomy has evolved as an option to conventional open gastrectomy. Trials from East Asia for early gastric cancer with risk factors for lymph node metastases, have shown that laparoscopic distal gastrectomy is non-inferior with regard to overall survival and has less wound complications compared with open distal gastrectomy.102, 103 Concerning locally advanced (T2-T4a) gastric cancer, published short-term results from the Korean KLASS-02 trial104 showed less morbidity, less postoperative pain, and shorter length of stay after laparoscopic compared with open distal gastrectomy. Regarding survival, preliminary reports from KLASS-02 and the European STOMACH105 and LOGICA trials106 suggest non-inferiority with regard to survival for laparoscopic surgery. However, more data are still needed, especially concerning total gastrectomy. Laparoscopic gastrectomy done robotically, with enhanced dexterity and three-dimensional high-resolution vision, is gaining popularity, but has so far not been shown to differ from conventional laparoscopic gastrectomy with regard to outcomes. With the ongoing rate of technical evolution, it's likely that gastric cancer surgery in the future will increasingly be minimally invasive and will probably take advantage of the rapidly developing robotic and artificial intelligence technologies.
Neoadjuvant and perioperative chemotherapy
Treatment with chemotherapy before surgery increases the chance for curative resection, eliminates early microscopic spread, and allows an in-vivo response assessment of treatment. Based on the results of randomised controlled trials, preoperative and perioperative chemotherapy became the standard for the management of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer in the Western hemisphere and in parts of the Asia–Pacific region (figure 3).107, 108, 109, 110, 111 The UK Medical Research Council's MAGIC trial107 showed an improvement in the 5-year survival rate from 23% to 36% for patients with resectable stage 2 and 3 gastric cancers treated with six cycles (three preoperative and three postoperative) of ECF (epirubicin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy compared with surgery alone. The European Society for Medical Oncology treatment guidelines73 for gastric cancer give a strong recommendation for perioperative (preoperative and postoperative) chemotherapy with a platinum or fluoropyrimidine combination for patients with stage 1B or greater resectable gastric cancer. The chemotherapy duration during both the preoperative and postoperative period is generally 2–3 months.73 Recently, the FLOT regimen (5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel) had better pathological response rates and higher R0 resection rates compared with ECF or epirubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and capecitabine (ECX) in a randomised controlled trial.112 FLOT resulted in a better overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0·77, 95% CI 0·63–0·94; median overall survival 50 months [38·33 to not reached] vs 35 months [27·35–46·26]). FLOT is now the recommended standard of care for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer who can tolerate a perioperative three drug combination regimen (table). Despite this progress, cure rates (approximately 40%) remain poor and novel strategies are needed. One investigational approach is tailoring perioperative treatment according to radiological or histopathological response. Previous studies on PET-based response assessment as a correlate for early metabolic changes in oesophago-gastric junction cancer showed notable but non-definitive results.116, 117 The postoperative continuation of chemotherapy in patients who responded incompletely to the preoperatively given cycles is also a matter of debate.118 Currently, the EORTC-1707 VESTIGE trial119 is investigating the role of adjuvant immunotherapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with a high risk for relapse, such as tumours that have cancer cells found in lymph nodes at resection following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or patients who have a margin positive (R1) resection (NCT03443856).

Preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy
The addition of postoperative radiotherapy to perioperative or adjuvant chemotherapy is currently not recommended. Randomised controlled trials showed that the addition of radiotherapy does not result in a better overall survival after quality-assured gastrectomy with more than D1 or D2 lymphadenectomy.120, 121 The results of the ARTIST trial raised the hypothesis that the addition of radiotherapy to adjuvant chemotherapy might benefit patients with lymph node-positive disease, but the ARTIST-2 trial did not confirm this observation.121, 122 Results from ongoing trials investigating preoperative radiotherapy plus perioperative chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer are awaited.123, 124 Patients with less than D1+ or D2 lymphadenectomy or with R1 resection could benefit from postoperative radiochemotherapy.125, 126
Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy
Several Japanese and South Korean have shown improvements in overall survival using adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy is fluoropyrimidine based using either monotherapy with S-1 (a combination of tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil) or combination treatment with capecitabine and oxaliplatin or S-1 and docetaxel. Adjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care for Asian patients (table).114, 126 Of note, in these Asian landmark studies that proved the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy, the patients had received D2 lymphadenectomy. In contrast, studies on adjuvant chemotherapy done in non-Asian patients did not improve survival but patients received more variable surgery that did not always include a D2 lymphadenectomy. A large individual patient-level meta-analysis of adjuvant chemotherapy in gastric cancer showed a moderate 6% absolute benefit for 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy compared with surgery alone (HR 0·82, 95% CI 0·76–0·90, p<0·001) in all subgroups tested.115 As adjuvant chemotherapy is also less well tolerated than neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a perioperative approach is preferred outside of East Asia, so that more patients can benefit from systemic treatment even if the postoperative component of treatment cannot be delivered.73
Future perspectives of perioperative treatment
Trastuzumab combined with fluoropyrimidine and platinum chemotherapy prolonged overall survival of patients with HER2-positive inoperable gastric cancer.127 The value of anti-HER2-directed trastuzumab or trastuzumab and pertuzumab in addition to perioperative chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive resectable gastric cancer is currently under investigation in the EORTC-1203 INNOVATION study (NCT02205047).128
A retrospective analysis129 from a French National registry suggested no benefit for perioperative chemotherapy in patients with resectable signet ring cell type gastric cancer.129 This observation was not confirmed in a subsequent prospective randomised controlled trial comparing perioperative chemotherapy with primary surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with resectable signet ring cell type gastric cancer.130 Therefore, the current recommendation of perioperative chemotherapy for resectable locally advanced gastric cancer should be applied to all patients irrespective of histological subtype.
Retrospective analyses and large clinical trials suggest that DNA-mismatch repair deficient or MSI resectable gastric cancers have a favourable prognosis compared with mismatch repair proficient or microsatellite stable gastric cancer, but the benefit from perioperative or adjuvant chemotherapy has been topic of debate.50, 131 Despite pooled data sets, due to the low incidence of MSI in gastric cancer, the number of analysed MSI gastric cancers is still limited. Therefore, the debate whether perioperative chemotherapy should be given or not in patients with resectable MSI gastric cancer is ongoing. Each case should be discussed in the multidisciplinary tumour board and an individualised decision for each patient depending on patient and tumour characteristics is needed.51, 132
Chemotherapy for patients with advanced gastric cancer
Chemotherapy improves survival and quality of life for patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer.133, 134, 135 Patients with gastric cancer who are treated with combination chemotherapy have a median overall survival of around 1 year (patients in Asia tend to have modestly longer survival) compared with 3–4 months when treated with supportive care alone (figure 4).134, 135, 136, 137, 138 Therefore, chemotherapy should be offered to patients with adequate performance status and organ function.73, 139, 140

CPS=combined proportion score. CF/X=cisplatin and 5FU or capecitabine. FISH=fluorescent in situ hybridisation. 5FU=5 fluorouracil. FOLFOX=5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, and oxaliplatin.
Chemotherapy drugs that are active in gastric cancer include fluoropyrimidines (5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, S-1, and trifluridine–tipiracil), platinums, taxanes, and irinotecan. S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine comprised of tegafur (an oral 5-fluorouracil prodrug), gimeracil (a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase inhibitor), and oteracil (an inhibitor of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase).141, 142 S-1 is more frequently used in Asia as it is less well tolerated in non-Asian populations because of pharmacogenomic differences in S-1 metabolism.143, 144 TAS118, a combination of S1 plus leucovorin has also showed promise in Asian patients.145 There are no validated biomarkers to guide chemotherapy selection in advanced gastric cancer.
First-line chemotherapy
For the initial treatment of patients with metastatic gastric cancer, a platinum–fluoropyrimidine doublet is preferred (figure 5).73, 139, 140 Cisplatin and oxaliplatin are considered equivalent in terms of efficacy; however, they have differing spectra of side-effects. Cisplatin is associated with more thromboembolic disease and renal dysfunction, whereas oxaliplatin is associated with higher rates of neuropathy and diarrhoea.146, 147 Infused and oral fluoropyrimidines are considered equivalent in efficacy; however, capecitabine is associated with higher rates of hand-foot syndrome.146 Irinotecan could also be used in combination with fluoropyrimidines for patients in whom platinum is contraindicated.148 For older patients (aged >65 years), oxaliplatin might be more effective and has a superior safety profile.149 The GO-2 trial150 showed that in older, frail patients with metastatic gastric cancer, a reduced dose oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy was equivalent to standard dose chemotherapy in terms of progression free survival and was more acceptable to patients and oncologists.

Doublet versus triplet chemotherapy
Triplet chemotherapy with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and docetaxel improved survival compared with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil alone in a phase 3 randomised trial, but is associated with high rates of serious neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, even when prophylactic granulocyte colony stimulating factor is used.138, 151 In a recent phase 3 Japanese randomised trial,152 a triplet of docetaxel, cisplatin and, S-1 did not improve survival compared with cisplatin and S-1 alone. Due to the questionable benefit of triplet chemotherapy compared with doublet treatment, and a clear increase in toxicity when a three drug treatment is used, taxane-based triplet chemotherapy might be reserved for patients who are very fit or those with a high burden of disease in whom a rapid response is desirable.73, 139
Biologics in first-line advanced gastric cancer: trastuzumab
Amplification of the HER2 (also known as ERBB2) oncogene and overexpression of the HER2 protein occur in approximately 17–20% of patients with gastric cancers, and is more common in intestinal-type gastric cancer and cancers located in the proximal stomach or at the gastroesophageal junction.41, 153 Patients with HER2 overexpressing gastric cancer benefit from treatment with the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab.127 In the randomised controlled TOGA trial,128 patients treated with trastuzumab plus cisplatin and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy had improved median overall survival compared with patients treated with chemotherapy alone. In the highly sensitive subgroup (HER2 immunohistochemistry [IHC] score 3+ or HER2 IHC 2+, and fluorescent in situ hybridisation [FISH]-positive), median overall survival was 16 months for chemotherapy and trastuzumab treated patients compared with 11·1 months in patients treated with chemotherapy alone (HR 0·74, 95% CI 0·60–0·91, p=0·0046; figure 5). Patients with HER2 overexpressing (HER2 3+ IHC or HER2 IHC 2+ and FISH-positive) gastric cancer should be treated with trastuzumab in addition to first-line chemotherapy, followed by trastuzumab monotherapy as maintenance.73, 139, 140 Currently there is no evidence to support trastuzumab beyond progression after first-line chemotherapy or before surgery in patients with resectable gastric cancer.
HER2 overexpressing gastric cancer has several unique characteristics including heterogeneity of HER2 expression and loss of dependence on HER2 signalling after trastuzumab treatment.154, 155 As a result, separate guidelines for HER2 testing in gastric cancer have been developed.156 A minimum of 5 tumour containing biopsies is required to confirm HER2 expression level and a biopsy of primary and metastatic sites also increases the detection of HER2 positive patients.156, 157, 158 Unlike breast cancer, neither pertuzumab (first line) nor trastuzumab–emtansine (second line) have been effective at improving survival for patients who have HER2 overexpressing gastric cancer.159, 160 However, ongoing trials using anti-HER2 therapy in second-line gastric cancer require biopsies to show retained HER2 overexpression and new anti-HER2 molecules such as trastuzumab–deruxtecan show promise.161, 162
Chemotherapy for previously treated advanced gastric cancer
In the second-line setting, patients who are fit for chemotherapy might be offered taxane or irinotecan chemotherapy that improve survival compared with best supportive care in randomised trials; however, the benefit from second-line chemotherapy is limited.163, 164, 165 Median overall survival of patients treated with second-line chemotherapy in clinical trials is approximately 6 months. The average benefit in overall survival in clinical trials for second line chemotherapy is 6 weeks. Patients with excellent performance status who have had a sustained response to first-line chemotherapy derive the most benefit from second-line treatment.166 In countries where ramucirumab is funded, the combination of paclitaxel and ramucirumab is preferred as second-line therapy due to improved survival (figure 5).167 For patients with gastric cancer whose disease has progressed after second-line chemotherapy, trifluridine–tipiracil (an oral nucleoside analog plus thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor) improves overall survival compared with best supportive care.168
Anti-angiogenic therapy in advanced gastric cancer
Anti-angiogenic therapy with ramucirumab (an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor 2 receptor antibody) has shown clinical use both as monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel for patients with gastric cancer who have progressed after first-line chemotherapy. In the second line REGARD trial,169 ramucirumab improved survival compared with best supportive care, whereas in the RAINBOW trial167 the combination of ramucirumab and paclitaxel improved survival compared with paclitaxel alone.168, 169 However, neither ramucirumab nor bevacizumab (an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody) improved survival when added to platinum or fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy in patients with treatment naive gastric cancer.136, 170
Immunotherapy for patients with advanced gastric cancer
Immune checkpoint blockade is now established as a treatment for chemorefractory gastric cancer (cancer which has progressed after two or more lines of chemotherapy). The phase 3 randomised ATTRACTION-2 trial171 showed improved overall survival for Asian patients treated with the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab compared with placebo plus best supportive care.171 The phase 2 non-randomised KEYNOTE-059 trial172 showed similar overall survival for an international chemorefractory gastric cancer patient population treated with pembrolizumab, another PD-1 antibody. In KEYNOTE 059, radiological response rates were improved in patients who had tumours that expressed PD-L1 protein on tumour and immune cells. Radiological response rates and overall survival are also substantially higher in patients with mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite unstable cancers, and tumour agnostic indications exist for treatment of MSI cancers with anti-PD-1 therapy.172
However, immune checkpoint blockade has not been successful until recently in earlier lines of therapy; pembrolizumab did not improve survival compared with paclitaxel in second line gastric cancer patients who expressed PD-L1 at a low level (CPS ≥1).173 In the first line KEYNOTE-062 trial, pembrolizumab showed non-inferiority to chemotherapy in patients who had PD-L1-positive (CPS ≥1) gastric cancer.174 However, response rates to anti-PD-1 monotherapy were low and many patients had early progression. In KEYNOTE-062, overall survival was improved compared with chemotherapy in pembrolizumab monotherapy treated patients who had tumours with high expression of PD-L1 (CPS ≥10), although this finding was not statistically significant (figure 5), and this group requires further study in future. Despite encouraging early results for the combination of chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 therapy, the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy did not improve survival compared with chemotherapy alone in a randomised trial regardless of PD-L1 expression status.174, 175 However, early reports from the ATTRACTION-4176 and CHECKMATE 649177 trials suggest that the combination of nivolumab with chemotherapy might be more effective than chemotherapy alone. Other biomarkers including EBV and tumour mutation burden are currently being evaluated.
Novel targets in gastric cancer
Novel targets that are under investigation in gastric cancer include Claudin-18.2 (more commonly expressed in diffuse type gastric cancer), inhibitors of the fibroblast growth receptor 2 pathway, and combinations of anti-angiogenic therapies and immune checkpoint blockade.41, 178, 179, 180, 181
Palliative care for gastric cancer patients
Patients with advanced gastric cancer benefit from a holistic approach to care, in addition to chemotherapy. Nutritional advice should be provided to minimise avoidable weight loss; dietary changes or supplementation could be recommended.182 Bleeding tumours could be addressed with endoscopic coagulation, tranexamic acid, radiotherapy, embolisation, or rarely surgery.183 The REGATTA trial184 did not show improved survival for palliative gastrectomy in addition to chemotherapy. Radiotherapy might be helpful in palliating painful metastases or dysphagia.185 Endoscopic stent placement might also relieve dysphagia for patients with proximal gastric cancer or relieve vomiting in patients with gastric outlet obstruction. Early referral to palliative care services can improve symptom control and quality of life; palliative care should be considered an essential part of the patient pathway and not mutually exclusive with active treatment such as chemotherapy.186
Ongoing challenges and future directions
Challenges for gastric cancer are epidemiological and therapeutic. The first aim must be to reduce the incidence rate of gastric cancer through ongoing attention to improved public health, implementation of endoscopic screening programmes in high-risk areas, and development of novel, less invasive tools for early detection. A major challenge is to translate recent discoveries in molecular biology to effective treatment for patients with gastric cancer. Intratumoural, intrapatient, and interpatient heterogeneity in gastric cancer remains a crucial barrier to drug development for targeted therapies and therefore more research is needed to understand how these challenges can be overcome. Additionally, most gastric cancers are not sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapies and thus patients with gastric cancer will probably require combination therapy to improve responses to anti-PD-1 therapy or other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Over the next few years, trials that have the potential to change clinical practice include the VESTIGE trial (NCT03443856; adjuvant immunotherapy vs chemotherapy), TOPGEAR study (NCT01924819; chemoradiotherapy vs chemotherapy before surgery in operable gastric cancer), INNOVATION study (NCT02205047; chemotherapy vs chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 therapy in operable gastric cancer), and SPOTLIGHT trial (NCT03504397; chemotherapy vs chemotherapy plus claudiximab (anti-Claudin18.2) in first line metastatic gastric cancer), as well as future trials of the anti-HER2 antibody drug conjugate trastuzumab dexrutecan and combinations of anti-PD-1 therapy with anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
