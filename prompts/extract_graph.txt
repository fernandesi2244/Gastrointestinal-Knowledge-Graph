-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
 
-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)
 
2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)
 
3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.
 
4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Text:
Esophageal cancer is primarily categorized into squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Chronic acid reflux, obesity, and smoking are key risk factors, particularly for adenocarcinoma. Patients often present with progressive dysphagia and chest pain. Treatment may include esophagectomy, radiation therapy, and endoscopic mucosal resection. Lifestyle modifications like weight loss and avoiding tobacco are advised for prevention.

Text:
Anal cancer is a relatively rare malignancy that occurs in the tissues of the anus. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, especially with high-risk strains like HPV-16, is a major risk factor. Other contributing risk factors include a history of receptive anal intercourse, immunosuppression, and smoking. Symptoms can include rectal bleeding, anal pain, and a palpable mass.

Treatment options often involve a combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The HPV vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing infection with high-risk HPV types and may reduce the risk of anal cancer.

Entity_types: CANCER, RISK-FACTOR, CAUSE, SYMPTOM, TREATMENT, PREVENTATIVE-MEASURE
Text:
Bile duct cancer, or cholangiocarcinoma, is a rare but aggressive malignancy that forms in the bile ducts, which transport bile from the liver to the small intestine.

Risk factors include primary sclerosing cholangitis, chronic liver disease, and liver fluke infections.

Common symptoms are jaundice, pruritus, and pale stools. Treatments include surgical resection, liver transplantation in select cases, and adjuvant chemotherapy.

Avoiding liver fluke exposure and managing underlying liver conditions are considered preventative measures.
